# Warehouse_List

Page 1:
I am giving a list of warehouses in the most optimal and modular way possible.

The listing page should have these feature(you may add more)
-> search the warehouses by warehouse name
-> filter warehouse based on
	-> city
	-> cluster
	-> space available limit
Refer to warehouses.json shared with this mail

Page 2:
Click on an item should redirect to the warehouse details page.

The details page should have edit functionality to edit the warehouse information such as cluster, warehouse name, city, space available, and warehouse live status.

This is the UI link of my projects :-  https://warehouse-silk.vercel.app/
